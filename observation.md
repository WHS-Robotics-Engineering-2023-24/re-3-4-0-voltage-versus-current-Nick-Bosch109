I am observing that as you lower the voltage the current is much slower, when the voltage gets down to 1 the circut stops working in general.
But as the voltage gets higher the current gets super fast, I chnaged mine to 10 and it was going super sonic speeds it seemed.
So as voltage lowers current does the same and vise versa, that is how they interact with eact other.
